# Computer Graphics Portfolio Project: Hole in the Wall Scene
## Author: Theresa Quach
### Description: Portfolio project for my computer graphics course at Oregon State University using OpenGL/C++ to animate and render a scene of my own design. The scene consists of two rooms with animated and stationary lighting and textures applied. OBJ objects were imported to fill each room for storytelling purposes. 

To run: 

1. Download and extract all zip files into the same directory (root directory). 
2. Move files from the following folders into the root directory: OBJ, Textures, Sample, Sample.VC, Additional Project Files
    *** You may keep files within the folders Debug and glm within their respective folders.***
3. Open the project in your IDE by clicking and running Sample.sln
4. Within your IDE, right-click on the Source file CS450 Final project.cpp
